# Privacy Policy

This web application collects nothing: no analytics, no telemetry, no tracking, no ads, no cookies and no third-party scripts. Nothing goes to the developer or to any server. The whole tool runs on your device.

## What is processed and where it stays

All of the following stays on your device and is never uploaded:

- The live data of the scooter, read over Bluetooth LE.
- The settings you make (open value, eKFV value, options). They are stored locally in the browser (localStorage) only.
- The log on screen. It lives only in the open page. The device name and id are anonymized, and the plaintext PIN as well as any credentials or tokens are redacted before anything is stored, shown, copied or saved.

## Network connections

- **Loading the page:** your browser fetches the static files from the host (for example GitHub Pages). The host sees your IP address and which file you requested, the usual access logs. Scooter data or commands never reach any server.
- **Bluetooth LE to the scooter:** a local radio link, not an internet connection. Commands and the scooter replies run only between your browser and the scooter.
- **Nothing else.** The page's Content Security Policy allows `connect-src 'self'` only, so the page cannot talk to any other server even if it wanted to.

## Note on the official app

The official PURE app (`com.zydtech.Pure`, a HobbyWing-ESC OEM app) downloads a firmware registry from a vendor server (`hobbywing.com`) to resolve your controller and its firmware options. This page does **not**. It speaks only to the scooter over Bluetooth and needs no account.
